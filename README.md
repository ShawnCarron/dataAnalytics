# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains structured analytics projects focused on business problem solving, metric integrity, and practical data modeling.

The purpose of this portfolio is not just to showcase code, but to demonstrate disciplined analytical thinking and control over metrics.

## Approach & Philosophy

Strong analytics is not about writing queries that run.

It is about writing logic that preserves meaning.

Projects in this repository emphasize:

- Defined grain  
- Intentional joins  
- Defensive metric calculations  
- Clear business framing  
- Structured documentation  

This repository will continue to evolve as additional analytics projects are completed and documented.
