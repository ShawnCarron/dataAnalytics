# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains structured analytics projects focused on business problem solving, metric integrity, and practical data modeling.

The objective of this portfolio is not simply to showcase code, but to demonstrate disciplined analytical thinking, controlled metric design, and defensible logic.

Projects are built around realistic business scenarios such as conversion modeling, sales funnel analysis, revenue tracking, and performance diagnostics.

## What You’ll Find Here

Each project in this repository includes:

- A clearly defined business question  
- Explicit dataset assumptions  
- Structured analytical logic (primarily SQL)  
- Controlled aggregation and grain definition  
- Defensive metric calculations  
- Clear documentation of approach and outcomes  

Projects are organized into dedicated folders and include their own README files explaining:

- The problem being solved  
- The modeling decisions made  
- The query structure and logic  
- The resulting metrics and interpretations

## Current Projects

### Sales Funnel SQL Analysis

Event-based funnel modeling over a rolling 30-day window, including:

- Stage-to-stage conversion rates  
- Traffic source performance  
- Daily funnel trend analysis  
- Funnel drop-off modeling  

Project folder: [Sales Funnel SQL Analysis](sales-funnel-sql/)

## Tools & Technologies

- SQL (CTEs, conditional aggregation, conversion modeling)
- MySQL
- Git / GitHub for structured version control and documentation

Future additions will expand into:

- Power BI data modeling
- Python-based analytics workflows
- R-based statistical analysis

## Analytical Philosophy

Strong analytics is not about writing queries that execute.

It is about designing logic that preserves business meaning.

Projects in this repository emphasize:

- Defined grain before aggregation  
- Intentional join selection  
- Prevention of metric distortion  
- Clear separation of logic and presentation  
- Documentation that explains both *what* was built and *why*  

This portfolio will continue to evolve as additional analytics projects are developed and documented.
